	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124},
	abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research., Published research findings are sometimes refuted by subsequent evidence, says Ioannidis, with ensuing confusion and disappointment.},

Growing attention to fraud in the lay press suggests that the incidence of fraud is increasing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The reasons for retracting 742 English language research papers retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Reasons for retraction were initially dichotomised as fraud or error and then analysed to determine specific reasons for retraction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Error was more common than fraud (73.5\% of papers were retracted for error (or an undisclosed reason) vs 26.6\% retracted for fraud). Eight reasons for retraction were identified; the most common reason was scientific mistake in 234 papers (31.5\%), but 134 papers (18.1\%) were retracted for ambiguous reasons. Fabrication (including data plagiarism) was more common than text plagiarism. Total papers retracted per year have increased sharply over the decade (r=0.96; p\&lt;0.001), as have retractions specifically for fraud (r=0.89; p\&lt;0.001). Journals now reach farther back in time to retract, both for fraud (r=0.87; p\&lt;0.001) and for scientific mistakes (r=0.95; p\&lt;0.001). Journals often fail to alert the naïve reader; 31.8\% of retracted papers were not noted as retracted in any way.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Levels of misconduct appear to be higher than in the past. This may reflect either a real increase in the incidence of fraud or a greater effort on the part of journals to police the literature. However, research bias is rarely cited as a reason for retraction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Turing Way: A handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative research The Turing Way December 2022 Latest The Turing Way is an open source community-driven guide to reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative data science. The Turing Way book is collaboratively developed by its diverse community of researchers, learners, educators, and other stakeholders. The Turing Way project is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our github repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way. In 2020, the project underwent a major overhaul categorising chapters into 5 guides on reproducible research, project design, collaboration, communication and ethical research. Additionally, we added a community handbook to document all the practices designed and implemented towards the development of the project and community. This release in 2021 includes additional chapters developed by our contributors across five guides and the community handbook. In addition, all the project documents from the project are provided as they appear on The Turing Way GitHub repository including the Zenodo metadata: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.
